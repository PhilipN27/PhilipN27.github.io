            <h3>Elemental Hero</h3>
            <p>This was a group SER225 project. This was worked on for an entire semester and took all 4 of us to complete within 2 week intervals.
                This is a platformer game that was written and java and almost everything in the game was drawn by one of us.
                There were tons of challenges making this from git issues, to something as simple as getting an enemy to walk correctly.</p>

            <h3>Minecraft 1.19 mods</h3>
            <p>In this project there are a bunch of different mods that I created. There are new crops, lights, ores and more.
                The things that I chose to mod were things that I felt could've been better, or things that seemed challenging to make.
                This is all written in java, and depending on what I'm trying to do these mods can take a really long time to make. </p>
